      Ibrahim Elci (Â°1990) is a young Belgian with a heart for photography in
      all its forms. This cheerful photographer has found the perfect balance
      between his own work and press and advertising photography. Whether it is
      a first-time model, Mr. Average or a prominent politician: they all feel
      comfortable in front of his lens. Characteristic of the style used by
      Ibrahim is the mix of spontanity and sophistication, driven by creative
      impulses and accidental circumstances. Ibrahim enjoys creating his own
      world. A world in which he, the portrayed man or woman and his audience is
      happy and satisfied. His inner child is never far away. In his own work,
      he wants to offer an alternative to the colourless and grey photography
      that is so prominently present these days. The tools he uses are
      playfulness, a touch of naivety, lots of colour and a sense of humour.
      Nothing is as energizing as a successful photo shoot.
